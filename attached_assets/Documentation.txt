Objective:

This project aims to develop a Hierarchical AI Collaboration Framework (HACF) that breaks down complex software development tasks into multiple structured AI layers. Each layer specializes in a specific function, working together to ensure an efficient and high-quality software development pipeline.

Key Components of HACF:

The system operates through a structured sequence of AI models, each responsible for a different aspect of software development. The process is broken down as follows:

1️⃣ Task Definition & Planning Layer

• Model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo

• Role: Converts user requests into structured plans and well-formed prompts.

• Functionality:

• Analyzes the user’s input request.

• Structures it into an actionable plan.

• Outputs a formatted JSON containing required features and project structure.

Example Input:
"Build a secure, scalable task management app with authentication and database storage."

Example Output:

{ "Project": "Task Management App", "Features": [ "User authentication (JWT, OAuth)", "Task CRUD operations", "Database: PostgreSQL", "Frontend: React, Backend: Flask" ], "Next_Prompt": "Generate a structured development plan." } 

2️⃣ Refinement & Base Structure Layer

• Model: deepseek-reasoner

• Role: Converts the high-level plan into a technical roadmap with base code structure.

• Functionality:

• Assigns specific frameworks, libraries, and data models.

• Creates an outline for frontend, backend, and database.

• Ensures project feasibility and consistency.

Example Output:

{ "Frontend": { "Framework": "React", "Components": ["Task List", "Task Form", "Authentication"] }, "Backend": { "Framework": "Flask", "API_Endpoints": ["/register", "/login", "/tasks"] }, "Database": { "Type": "PostgreSQL", "Tables": ["Users", "Tasks"] }, "Next_Prompt": "Generate the full backend code for Flask API." } 

3️⃣ Development & Execution Layer

• Model: codestral-latest or claude-3-7-sonnet

• Role: Generates fully functional code based on structured inputs.

• Functionality:

• Implements frontend and backend components.

• Ensures API and database integration.

• Writes clean, modular, and scalable code.

Example Output (Backend Code):

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request import psycopg2 app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/tasks', methods=['GET']) def get_tasks(): return jsonify([{ "id": 1, "name": "Example Task" }]) if __name__ == "__main__": app.run(debug=True) 

4️⃣ Debugging, Optimization & Security Layer

• Model: gpt-4o

• Role: Reviews, debugs, and optimizes generated code.

• Functionality:

• Identifies syntax errors and logical inconsistencies.

• Adds security features (e.g., input validation, authentication enforcement).

• Refactors inefficient code for performance improvements.

Example Fixes:

• Adding JWT authentication.

• Preventing SQL injection.

• Optimizing API endpoints.

Example Final Output (Improved Flask API):

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required import psycopg2 app = Flask(__name__) app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'super-secret' jwt = JWTManager(app) @app.route('/tasks', methods=['GET']) @jwt_required() def get_tasks(): return jsonify([{ "id": 1, "name": "Secure Task" }]) if __name__ == "__main__": app.run(debug=True) 

5️⃣ Final Output to User

• The refined and reviewed code is returned to the user.

• Optionally, logs of each processing step can be provided.

• Ensures a transparent, structured AI-driven development pipeline.

Enhancements & Scalability Considerations:

To further optimize HACF, consider:

• Parallel Processing: Allow frontend & backend development to occur simultaneously.

• Self-Evaluating Prompts: Each layer assigns a confidence score to detect and handle potential errors.

• Automated Testing Layer: Additional AI models dedicated to security auditing and deployment automation.

Implementation Instructions for a New LLM

• Choose LLMs Based on Their Strengths:

• Meta-Llama for planning & structuring.

• DeepSeek for refinement & architecture design.

• Code-specialized models (Claude, Codestral) for development.

• GPT-4o for debugging, optimization & security checks.

• Create a Pipeline That Passes Outputs Sequentially to Each AI Layer.

• Ensure JSON Formatting at Every Step to Maintain Clarity & Consistency.

• Validate Security & Performance Metrics Before Delivering Final Code.

• Implement a Feedback Loop Where the User Can Request Fixes or Enhancements.

Final Request for the Target LLM:

• Implement the Hierarchical AI Collaboration Framework (HACF) as outlined.

• Maintain structured AI layering with sequential output refinement.

• Ensure outputs are accurate, modular, and production-ready.

• Provide optional debug logs and structured explanations for each decision.

• Allow room for parallel execution & dynamic adjustments based on project requirements.
